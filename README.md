# Car Movies
A repository for the Laravel assignment at Yrgo. 

The project was done in collaboration by [Frida Fernhede](https://github.com/Fridish) and [Joar Hansson](https://github.com/JoarHansson).

The assignment was to create a small application in which the following Laravel features were used: 
- Controllers
- Migrations
- HTTP Tests (on all routes)
- Middleware
- Models (with relationships)
- Routes (with route model binding)
- Eloquent
- Validation
- Blade views
- At least one of the models should have CRUD capability.

In the project we have gained experience of working with the Laravel framework, and learned about applying the MVC software design pattern.
